# android-developlement-final-project
This is the final project of my Android Devlopment 2 course - De' Patisserie Cakes N' Desserts.

 
De’ Patisserie Cakes N Desserts is a business whose goal is to spread love and joy 
through its sweet and tasty treats. Using Android Studio and writing in the Java Language, 
this application was created to allow the clients of De’ Patisserie Cakes N Desserts to easily 
order their favorite treats from the convenience of their mobile devices and comfort of their 
homes. 
The purpose of the development of the application is to provide an efficient way for 
customers to purchase/order products such as Cupcakes and Cakes from De’Patisserie 
Cakes N Desserts with ease. By using the application, customers wouldn’t have to interact 
with anyone until it’s time to collect their order. Using the application also allows customers 
to order as often as they want and eliminates the process of having to take time to call the 
bakery possibly waiting for an answer. They would be able to order what they want in a 
matter of seconds. Users can log into the application and view what special offers the 
bakery is offering for the day. Users can then proceed to the order screen where they would 
have the ability to choose which item they would like to add to their cart then place an order 
for. Within the Cart Screen, users would be able to see what items they have added to their 
cart and have the options to either remove them, increase the quantity of the item or place 
their order of selected items.
